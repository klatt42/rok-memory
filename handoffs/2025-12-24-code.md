## Session Summary

Successfully deployed and validated ROK 3.2 Self-Improvement Scoring System:

### Completed
1. **Deployed /diary v2.0** - 5-criterion self-scoring rubric
   - Criteria: Completion, Quality, Efficiency, Learning, Communication
   - Scale: 1-10 with clear anchors
   - Quality bar: 7.0 (triggers reflection if below)

2. **Deployed /reflect v2.0** - Score aggregation and trend analysis
   - Criterion-level breakdown
   - Project comparison
   - Pattern correlation detection

3. **Created expertise knowledge base**
   - `~/.claude/expertise/self-improvement-patterns.md`
   - Score history CSV tracking
   - Reflection reports

4. **Validated with 3 scored sessions**
   - Overall average: 8.4/10
   - Quality bar: 100% met (3/3)
   - Key insight: Session type affects criterion distribution

5. **Git repository initialized**
   - `~/.claude/` now tracked in git
   - Pushed to GitHub: `klatt42/rok-claude-config` (private)
   - 73 files, 21,879 lines
