# Desktop Handoff - 2024-12-20-14:45

## Session Summary
Chrome connector successfully tested and working with Claude Desktop.

## Key Findings

### Chrome Connector Status
- Extension version 1.0.2339 working
- Requires manual enable per-conversation via Connectors dropdown
- Only works with Claude 4.5 models (Haiku/Sonnet/Opus 4.5)

### Desktop Filesystem Reality
- Desktop runs in cloud container, NOT local
- `/mnt/user-data/outputs/` = download staging, not Windows path
- Cannot write directly to Windows or WSL filesystem
- GitHub push blocked by proxy (auth headers stripped)
- Can READ public GitHub repos

### Bridge Architecture Confirmed
| Direction | Method |
|-----------|--------|
| Desktop → Code | Ron relays (or Desktop outputs, Ron commits via Code) |
| Code → Desktop | Code pushes to GitHub, Desktop reads public repo |

## Action Items for CC
1. rok-memory bridge requires Ron as relay for Desktop→Code
2. MCP Filesystem Server would fix this (future improvement)
3. Current workflow: Desktop outputs to chat, Ron says "commit to rok-memory", CC handles git

## Test
If you're reading this, the relay worked.
