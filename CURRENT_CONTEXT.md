## What's Happening Now

ROK 3.2 Self-Improvement Scoring System is now deployed and validated.

### Completed Today (2025-12-24)
- Deployed /diary v2.0 with 5-criterion self-scoring
- Deployed /reflect v2.0 with score aggregation
- Created self-improvement-patterns.md knowledge base
- Validated with 3 scored sessions (8.4 avg, 100% quality bar)
- Initialized git repo for ~/.claude/
- Pushed to GitHub: klatt42/rok-claude-config

### Active Work
- ROK 3.2 validation complete
- Ready for continued use across projects

### Next Steps
1. Use /diary with scoring on real work sessions
2. Run /reflect after 5+ more entries
3. Consider Phase 2 (Supabase) after 10+ entries
4. Backup WSL/Desktop to D: drive (pending)

## Decisions Made Today

1. **Scoring rubric**: 5 criteria, 1-10 scale, 7.0 threshold
2. **Phase 1 approach**: File-based scoring before Supabase
3. **Git tracking**: ~/.claude/ now version controlled
